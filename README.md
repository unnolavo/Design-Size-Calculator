# Design Size Calculator

This tool helps estimate the real-life size of a design element on a product based on a known full side measurement and on-screen measurements.

## How to Use
1. Choose your unit (inches or centimeters).
2. Select whether you're calculating for WIDTH or HEIGHT.
3. Enter:
   - TRUE full product measurement (e.g., 40 inches)
   - On-screen full measurement of the product
   - On-screen measurement of the design element
4. Click "Calculate"

The result will show the **estimated real-life size of the design element**.
